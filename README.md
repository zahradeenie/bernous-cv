# Bernous CV

We make jokes about our cat, Bernous, making lots of gluten because he likes to stretch his toebeans on every blanket he can find. This is me playing around making a little CV for him.

It includes one interactive element using LiveView which is a button to increase Bernous' gluten development by giving him pets.
